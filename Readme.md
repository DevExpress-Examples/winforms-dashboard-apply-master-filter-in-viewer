# BI Dashboard for WinForms - How to Set Master Filter in Dashboard Viewer

The following example demonstrates how to set master filter in the [Dashboard Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer) control.

The Dashboard Viewer control loads a dashboard with two master filter items - the Grid and Range Filter dashboard items. The Chart item displays the filtered data.  

The [DashboardViewer.ConfigureDataConnection](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.ConfigureDataConnection) event is handled to specify the [Extract Data Source](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115900/creating-dashboards/creating-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/providing-data/extract-data-source) filename. The [DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardTitle](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.CustomizeDashboardTitle) event handler creates the command button that executes the application's SetMasterFilterMethod procedure.

The SetMasterFilterMethod procedure uses the [DashboardViewer.SetMasterFilter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.SetMasterFilter.overloads)Â method to select the rows in the [Grid]( https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15150) Â dashboard item. The [DashboardViewer.SetRange](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.SetRange.overloads)Â method selects the range in the [Range Filter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15265)Â dashboard item.

This example also demonstrates how to handle the [DashboardViewer.MasterFilterSet](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.MasterFilterSet) and [DashboardViewer.MasterFilterCleared](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.MasterFilterCleared) events.
